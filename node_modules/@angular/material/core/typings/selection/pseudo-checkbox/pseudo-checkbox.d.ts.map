This is *not*\n * interchangeable with <mat-checkbox> and should *not* be used if the user would directly interact\n * with the checkbox. The pseudo-checkbox should only be used as an implementation detail of\n * more complex components that appropriately handle selected / checked state.\n * @docs-private\n */\nexport declare class MatPseudoCheckbox {\n    /** Display state of the checkbox. */\n    state: MatPseudoCheckboxState;\n    /** Whether the checkbox is disabled. */\n    disabled: boolean;\n}\n"]}
